# Eva - Eva Virtual Assistant

Let algorithms decide your life.


## Disclaimer: work in progress

This project hasn't reached an alpha state yet. At the moment, it is just a tiny
CLI wrapper around a simple scheduling algorithm. Some people already find this
useful however, so maybe you do too!


## Goal

Eva aims to be an opinionated application to manage your life when you don't
feel like doing that yourself. It will mainly do this by managing your todo list
as much as possible, for example by scheduling your tasks automatically so you
are saved from that mental burden.

It borrows from various productivity and motivation concepts like GTD, Pomodoro,
the Eisenhower scheme, flow, focussing on one task, small-chunking work, eating
the frog, etc.



## Installation

Run `cargo build --release` and put the generated binary `./target/release/eva`
somewhere in your PATH.


## Usage

`eva --help` will get you started.

habits](http://zenhabits.net) and [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com) for
originally inspiring me! I also wouldn't have gotten this far without the
interesting discussions around scheduling algorithms with
